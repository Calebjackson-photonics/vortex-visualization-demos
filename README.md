# Vortex Visualization Demos

This repository contains educational Python scripts for visualizing synthetic optical vortex phase patterns relevant to wave optics and photonics research.

## What is an Optical Vortex?
An optical vortex is a light field carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) characterized by a helical phase structure around a central phase singularity.

These phase distributions can be visualized by plotting the angular phase term:

    phase = arctan2(y, x)

which reveals the characteristic spiral topology.
